        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</em><br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong><br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <em>we are born to learn.</em><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger.</strong><br>
        <em>Failing is just another word for growing.</em> And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it.<br>
        <em>You just don’t get it, yet.</em><br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <strong>basic ideas</strong> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
